## Getting Started on Windows

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the project on your Windows computer, even if you're new to web development.

### 1. Install Required Tools

Before you begin, you will need two free tools: Node.js and Git.

*   **Node.js:** This project requires Node.js version `22.17.1`. The easiest way to get the correct version is to download and install the **LTS** version from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download). This also installs the necessary package managers.
*   **Git:** This tool is used to copy the project files to your computer. Download and install it from the [Git for Windows website](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

You will run the following commands in a terminal. You can open one by searching for **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** in your Start Menu.

### 2. Get the Project Code

1.  **Copy the project files** to your computer by running this command in your terminal. Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL you find on the project's GitHub page under the "Code" button.
    ```powershell
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project folder:**
    ```powershell
    cd tem-portal
    ```

### 3. Install and Run the Project

We'll use PNPM, a fast and efficient package manager.

1.  **Enable `corepack`** (a tool included with Node.js) to manage package manager versions:
    ```powershell
    corepack enable
    ```

2.  **Set up PNPM:**
    ```powershell
    corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
    ```

3.  **Install project dependencies.** This downloads all the necessary libraries the project needs to run.
    ```powershell
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server.** This runs the website on your local machine.
    ```powershell
    pnpm dev
    ```

5.  **View the website.** Open your web browser and go to the following address: `http://localhost:4321`. You should see the application running.

### 4. (Optional) Build for Production

If you want to create a folder of optimized files for deployment to a web server, run the following command. The output will be placed in a `dist` folder.

```powershell
pnpm build
```
