# Cloudflare Pages Configuration Guide

## Overview
Your Telco application has been successfully deployed to Cloudflare Pages, but requires additional configuration in the Cloudflare Dashboard to enable session management functionality.

## Required Configuration Steps

### 1. Create KV Namespace for Sessions

1. Go to your Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Workers & Pages** → **KV**
3. Click **Create a namespace**
4. Name it: `telco-sessions` (or any descriptive name)
5. Copy the **Namespace ID** that gets generated

### 2. Configure KV Binding in Pages

1. Go to **Workers & Pages** → **grepsite** (your Pages project)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Functions**
3. Scroll down to **KV namespace bindings**
4. Click **Add binding**
5. Configure:
   - **Variable name**: `SESSION`
   - **KV namespace**: Select the `telco-sessions` namespace you created
6. Click **Save**

### 3. Deploy Environment Variables (if needed)

If you're using Supabase or other external services, also configure:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Add the following variables:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key
3. Click **Save and deploy**

## Verification

After configuring the KV binding:

1. The site should automatically redeploy
2. Visit `https://grepsite.mooshieblob.com/login`
3. Try logging in with the default credentials:
   - Email: `admin@bloblogic.com`
   - Password: `admin`

## Expected Behavior

Once properly configured:
- ✅ Login page loads without errors
- ✅ Authentication works and redirects to dashboard
- ✅ Session persistence across page refreshes
- ✅ Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login

## Troubleshooting

If you still see 500 errors after configuration:

1. Check the **Functions** tab in your Pages project for error logs
2. Verify the KV binding name is exactly `SESSION` (case-sensitive)
3. Ensure the KV namespace exists and is bound correctly
4. Try triggering a new deployment by making a small commit

## Current Status

- ✅ **Build**: Successful
- ✅ **Deploy**: Successful  
- ✅ **Worker**: Uploaded successfully
- ⚠️  **Runtime**: Needs KV binding configuration
- ⚠️  **Authentication**: Pending KV setup

The application is ready to work once the SESSION KV binding is configured in the Cloudflare Dashboard.
